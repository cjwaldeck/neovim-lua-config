# NeoVim configuration using Lua only

This is my NeoVim configuration. This configuration needs NeoVim v0.8 or higher!


# Default colorscheme

Set the default colorscheme by running the command:

    echo "nightfox" > ~/.config/nvim/colorscheme


# A good guide on how to setup NeoVim

My configuration is inspired by [Josean Martinez](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files) guide.
